Design, implementation and application of computational intelligence methods, for the prediction of intrinsically disordered proteins

The discovery of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) (i.e., biologically active proteins that do not possess stable secondary and/or tertiary structures) came as an unexpected surprise, as the existence of such proteins is in contradiction to the traditional "sequence structure function" paradigm. Accurate prediction of a protein's predisposition to be intrinsically disordered is a necessary prerequisite for the further understanding of principles and mechanisms of protein folding and function, and is a key for the elaboration of a new structural and functional hierarchy of proteins. 
Therefore, prediction of IDPs has attracted the attention of many researchers, and a number of prediction tools have already been developed. Predictions of disorder, in turn, are playing major roles in directing laboratory experiments that are leading to the discovery of even more disordered proteins, and thereby leading to a positive feedback loop in the investigation of these proteins
The point of this study (diploma thesis), is to create a computational intelligent method to predict intrinsically disordered regions in proteins. More specifically, our method is based on a classifier, which takes as an input a set of characteristics and attempts to predict if a protein sequence is ordered or disordered.
